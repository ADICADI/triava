# triava - Technology Compatibility Kit integration

This folder contains all information to check standards compliance via  
Technology Compatibility Kits (TCK). 

## JSR107 - Java Caching compliance
To verify compliance, clone the Technology Compatibility Kit from https://github.com/jsr107/jsr107tck .
```
 git clone https://github.com/jsr107/jsr107tck.git
 cd jsr107tck.git
 
 # Configure triava as implementation to test
 diff <TRIAVA_DISTRIBUTION>/tck/jsr107-pom.xml pom.xml
 # If changes look well, continue
 cp <TRIAVA_DISTRIBUTION>/tck/jsr107-pom.xml pom.xml
 
 # Run test
 mvn clean install
```

### Current compliance status:
- All core functionality tests pass. This includes creating and destroying caches. Also all put, get, replace, delete Operations work compliant. 
- Passes 341/465 tests. (73%)

## Unclear JSR107 Specs, but compliant according to TCK
The following tests or Specs are unclear and should be adressed to the JSR107 working group.

# RemoveTest.remove_2arg_NullValue()
	// The TCK test demands that we throw a NPE, which is IMO not required by the JSR107 Spec.
	// While a JCache may not contain null values, this does not mean to throw NPE. I would expect to return false.

# PutTest.putAll_NullKey()
	// It disallows partial success, even though this is not explicitly required, instead the Spec reads:
	//
	// " * The effect of this call is equivalent to that of calling
	//   * {@link #put(Object, Object) put(k, v)} on this cache once for each mapping
	//   * from key <tt>k</tt> to value <tt>v</tt> in the specified map.
	//   *
	// * The order in which the individual puts occur is undefined."
	//
	// There is no mention of a "rollback" for partial failures. In contrast CacheWriter has explicit documentation ("remove succesful writes from the Map").
	// The API / Spec should be changed to reflect the TCK test or vice versa.

# CacheManagerTest createCacheSameName() and createCacheSame()
	// Observation: Mandates to throw CacheException when "the same" cahe is to be created twice.
	// Issue: Javadocs has no "@throws CacheException". It is only in the text. 
	
# CacheManagerTest getNullTypeCacheRequest()
	// Observation: Mandates to throw NullPointerException when passing null as keyClass or valueClass
	// Issue: Javadocs and Spec do not mention behavior on null.
	
# org.jsr107.tck.event.CacheListenerTest.testFilteredListener(CacheListenerTest.java:396)
	// Observation: Unclear spec for Cache.remove(key): We need to use oldValue as value in the event. The Spec is not clear about this, but the TCK bombs
	// us with NPE when we would use null as "value" and oldValue as "old value". The JSR107 RI uses oldValue as "value" and leaves the "old value" unset.
	// org.jsr107.tck.event.CacheListenerTest$MyCacheEntryEventFilter.evaluate(CacheListenerTest.java:344)  // <<< Location of NPE

	
# CacheMBStatisticsBeanTest
	// Three wrong assertEquals() checks, where the "expected" and "actual" parameters are exchanged.
	// Has no influence on test result, but wrong test output.
	    assertEquals(result, "Sooty");
	    assertEquals(result, "Trinity");
	    
# Unclear spec which kind of Listener should fire on Evictions
	// Observation: Spec is unlcear. It talks about "evictions" when doing "expiration", but not about "true" evicitions.
	// ehcache sends EVICTED, it seems. I will go for it, but it should be clarified.
