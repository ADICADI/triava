/**
 * The purpose  of this annotation is to document how TimeZone aware Trivago's methods are, especially those in
 * TimeUtil. The background is that the time zone of several dates are not documented, including the booking period
 * fromDate and toDate in the request from PHP. PHP does not send UTC, but actually the current local time, which is
 * most of the times either CET, or CEST, resulting in UTC+1 or UTC+2.
 * <p>
 * <b>Aftermath</b>: After annotating several methods in the TimeUtil class the result is disastrous. <b>Only because
 * the MS/PS is Timezone unaware as PHP, the whole system works as expected</b>. If MS and PHP have different Timezone
 * descriptions or changing CET to CEST differently due to unequal clocks, the results will blow: fromDate and toDate
 * will shift back one day.
