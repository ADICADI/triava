/**
 * Hash based implementation of {@link Interner}. 
 * Identity is determined via {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()}, thus stored instances
 * must guarantee that hashCode is consistent with equals. This implementation can return different object
 * references in the case of two concurrent {@link #get(Object)} calls
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Speed</b>: The implementation is twice as fast as Guavas Interner, and 5 times as fast as String.intern().
 * Measurement via bb Microbenchmark tool (ticket SRT-6053). Time in microseconds (us) for 1000 interns:
 * <ul>
 * <li>18us triava HashInterner</li>
 * <li>32us Guava Weak Interner</li>
 * <li>39us Guava Strong Interner</li>
 * <li>88us String.intern() - the 88us average had a very high deviation.</li>
 * </ul>
