## Building:
triava requires Java 7 and depends on the JSR107 API javax.cache:cache-api:1.0.0. Dependencies are resolved by Maven. The following will build everything, including Javadoc and a source jar:

`mvn package`

This will create three artifacts in the target/ folder:

- triava-[version].jar
- triava-[version]-sources.jar
- triava-[version]-javadoc.jar

Maintainers can upload new versions to Maven Central Staging:

Before uploading a new version, you should:
 - Fix all Javadocs warnings
 - Run FindBugs and fix all bugs
 - Check for missing licensing header
 ```
 find . -name '*.java' -print0 | xargs -0 grep -L "Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0"
 ```
 - Update this README: Changes section
 - Update this README: Update all version numbers
 - Tag the release and upload (check with maintainers on details, e.g. in the triava Knowledge page)
```
version=1.0; git tag -a v$version -m "v$version"
mvn clean deploy -P release
```
