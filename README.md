The triava project contains several of trivago's core libraries for Java-based projects: caching, collections, annotations, concurrency libraries and more.


  
Building:
The following will build everything, including Javadoc and a source jar.

Inside the target/ folder, 3 files will be generated. For example for version 1.0:
