The triava project contains several of trivago's core libraries for Java-based projects: caching, collections, annotations, concurrency libraries and more.


  
# Building:
triava has no dependencies apart from Java 7. The following will build everything, including Javadoc and a source jar.
`mvn package`

Inside the target/ folder, 3 files will be generated. For example for version 1.0:
triava-1.0.jar triava-1.0-sources.jar triava-1.0-javadoc.jar

# Usage:
To start, look at the examples folder http://git.trivago.trv/srt/triava/tree/master/src/examples/java/com/trivago/examples
