# triava

The triava project contains several of trivago's core libraries for Java-based projects: caching, collections, annotations, concurrency libraries and more.

## Building:
triava requires Java 7 and depends on the JSR107 API javax.cache:cache-api:1.0.0. Dependencies are resolved by Maven. The following will build everything, including Javadoc and a source jar:

`mvn package`

This will create three artefacts in the target/ folder:

- triava-[version].jar
- triava-[version]-sources.jar
- triava-[version]-javadoc.jar

## Usage:
To start, look at the [examples folder](./src/examples/java/com/trivago/examples).

### Usage in Maven: pom.xml
```

    <dependency>

    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```

#### Maven Central
triava is available from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|a%3A%22triava%22)

Maintainers can upload new versions to Maven Central Staging:
`mvn clean deploy -P release`
